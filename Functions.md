# Functions in C++
### A Function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. It helps break large programs into smaller, logical parts. Functions make code cleaner, easier to understand, and more maintainable.

### Just like in other languages, C++ functions can take inputs (called parameters), execute a block of statements, and optionally return a result. C++ also supports advanced features like function overloading, default arguments, and inline functions, which give more flexibility compared to C.

# Function Overloading in C++
### Function overloading allows us to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. It is a form of compile time polymorphism in which different functions with same name can perform different jobs based on the different parameters passed.
### -> Avoids name conflicts and unnecessary function names
### -> Makes the code easy to understand and making user friendly as the same meaningful function name is used for different types of inputs.
